Travail,Ivan Castañeda,ivancas56@gmail.com,"In the hospitality industry, people who need a job encounter a big challenge: their scope of job postings is limited and they lack the proper networks in order to know where to look for possible temporary offerings. Moreover, a segment of students are looking for gigs that provide flexibility of schedule, variety in the work done and a fair payment for the job. 
In contrast, hospitality services owners and managers suffer from high staff turnover and permanent peaks on demand. On top of that, the process of finding temporary personnel is inefficient. 
As a result we created Travail, an on-demand platform that connects businesses in the hospitality industry with potential workers and students. On one hand solving staffing for last minute events or personnel absenteeism. On the other, allowing young people access jobs, get trainings and earn extra money.",Y
